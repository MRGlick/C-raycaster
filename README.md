# C - Multiplayer raycaster
This project was originally made as a simple raycaster with a small scope, but now due to scope creep it's becoming a multiplayer Free-For-All shooter with randomized abilities for me and my friends to play.

This project is written entirely in C (except for the export python script) and it uses SDL2 with SDL_gpu for rendering, input and audio. It also uses SDL_ttf for rendering text, and winsock.h for networking.
