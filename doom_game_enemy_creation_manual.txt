Steps to create your enemy in this spaghetti codebase!
- 1: Create the enemy struct (don't forget to 'inherit' the enemy struct)
- 2: Create the enemy type in the Types enum
- 3: Create your tick function and add it to objectTick
- 4: Add your enemy to the render and getRenderList functions
- 5: Add your enemy to rayObject()
- 6: Add your enemy to enemyTakeDmg and implement it's damage taking behaviour
- 7: Create a function to initialize your enemy

Now you have a (hopefully) very cool enemy added to your game!
